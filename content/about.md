I currently work with [Dr. Marisa Casillas](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/marisa-casillas) at the University of Chicago as the manager for the [Chatter Lab](https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/). Previously, I completed my BA in Psychology at Princeton University, where I worked with [Dr. Casey Lew-Williams](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/casey-lew-williams) as a thesis student in the [Princeton Baby 
Lab](http://babylab.princeton.edu/).

I study early language learning. My research focuses on how young children extract meaningful information from complex, everyday communicative contexts and explores which cues (linguistic, environmental, social, etc.) may support them most in doing so.
