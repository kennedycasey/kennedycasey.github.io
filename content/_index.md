<b>PhD student, Princeton Baby Lab</b>

<font size="-1"><span style="color:#9ea6a2">Department of Psychology, Princeton University</span></font>

I am a second-year PhD student in Psychology at Princeton University. I work with [Dr. Casey Lew-Williams](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/casey-lew-williams) in the [Princeton Baby Lab](https://babylab.princeton.edu/). Previously, I worked with [Dr. Marisa Casillas](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/marisa-casillas) at the University of Chicago as the manager for the [Chatter Lab](https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/). Broadly speaking, my research focuses on how young children's rich and highly variable everyday language input shapes their early word representations.
