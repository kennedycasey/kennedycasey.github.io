I currently work with [Dr. Marisa Casillas](https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/marisa-casillas) at the University of Chicago as the manager for the [Chatter Lab](https://chatterlab.uchicago.edu/). Previously, I completed my BA in Psychology at Princeton University, where I worked with [Dr. Casey Lew-Williams](https://psych.princeton.edu/person/casey-lew-williams) as a thesis student in the [Princeton Baby 
Lab](http://babylab.princeton.edu/). My research focuses on how young children build context-rich word representations from their everyday language input.<p align="right"><font size="-6"><span style="color:#55493c">Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.eriellebakkumphotography.com/">Erielle Bakkum</a></span></font></p>
